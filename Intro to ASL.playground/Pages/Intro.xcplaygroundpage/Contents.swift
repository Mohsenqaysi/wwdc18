//: ## What is ASL?
//:
//: American Sign Language (ASL) is a visual language. With signing, the brain processes linguistic information through the eyes. The shape, placement, and movement of the hands, as well as facial expressions and body movements, all play important parts in conveying information.
//:
//: Sign language is not a universal language — each country has its own sign language, and regions have dialects, much like the many languages spoken all over the world. Like any spoken language, ASL is a language with its own unique rules of grammar and syntax. Like all languages, ASL is a living language that grows and changes over time.
//:
//: ## Why sign language?
//:
//: The statistics are alarming. According to WHO approximately **10% of humanity is hearing-impaired**. Over 5% of the world’s population, more than **360 million people has disabling hearing loss** (328 million adults and 32 million children). The numbers are just increasing because changing natural conditions. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), 36 million Americans have a hearing loss—this includes 17% of the American adult population.
//: In Hungary, the number of hearing-impaired people is close to a million, which is 10% of the population. In 10 years, the number of deaf-mute people has increased by 15.85%.
//:
//: Most importantly, these people don’t live isolated, they live amongst us in families, thus this problem extends to way more people than the ones actually being deaf-mute.
//:
//:
//: ## You’re still not convinced?
//: We are talking about such a big amount of people, that they have their own Olympics, called the **Deaflympics**. They are being held every 4 years in both summers and winters. The last event was in Sophia, Bulgaria and in Vancouver, Canada in the winter.

//: ##
//: I believe that making an impact on people should start in their childhood. Therefore, it’s really important to integrate topics like this into education and create more interesting apps and games touching these subjects, so children will be more acceptable and it will be natural for them to live with other children who have such disabilities.

//: #### If can be equal in sports, we should teach children that we're equal in every other part of life.
